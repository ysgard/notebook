#+TITLE: SSH Notes

* Running Commands using SSH
** Running a command in a fire-and-forget screen session
You can run commands inside a detached screen session that will
terminate when the command does.  This is good for firing off
long-running processes (like repairs on a cassandra node) using a tool
like ~knife ssh~.
- This example will run a ~dd~ command insided such a session.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
ssh 10.200.10.200 'sudo screen -dm -S shared dd if=/dev/urandom of=/tmp/randblock bs=1K count=100'
#+END_SRC
