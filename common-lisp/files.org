#+TITLE: File Operations


* Write something to a file
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(with-open-file (my-stream
                 "testfile.txt"
                 :direction :output
                 :if-exists :supersede)
    (princ "Hello file!" my-stream))
#+END_SRC

* Redirect stdout to a file temporarily
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(with-open-file (*standard-output*
                 fname
                 :direction :output
                 :if-exists :supersede)
    (funcall thunk))
#+END_SRC
- This temporarily binds the stdout stream to the file defined in
  *fname*, then calls a function passed in named /thunk/.  Any printing
  /thunk/ does to stdout will instead be sent to the file *fname*.
