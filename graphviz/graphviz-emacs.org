#+TITLE: Graphviz Inside Emacs

Can use graphviz inside emacs to translate dot syntax into pngs.

To make this work, you need *org-babel* (which is included in Emacs 25).
You will also need to install *graphviz* and make sure that *dot* is in
the PATH.

Enable the /dot/ format with the following /elisp/:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(org-babel-do-load-languages 'org-babel-load-languages
  '((dot . t)))
#+END_SRC

Then in your ORG file specify dot syntax like so:
#+BEGIN_SRC dot :file dot_success.png :cmdline -Kdot -Tpng
digraph {
// graph from left to right
rankdir=LR;
splines=true;
node [shape=box];

id [label="Install Graphvix"]
conf [label="Configure org-babel"]
dot [label="DOT in org-mode"]

id -> conf
conf -> dot
dot -> "Profit"
dot -> "Success" [style=dotted]
}
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:dot_success.png]]

The with the cursor inside the block, press ~C-c C-c~ to evaluate the
code.  Emacs will create the file /dot_success.png/ and put the link in
a ~#+RESULTS~ section.
