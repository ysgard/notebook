#+TITLE: Dockerfile Notes

* General Principles
- Docker images are tarballs containing union FS layers.
- When transferring images, only the new/changed layers are
  transferred.
- A changed layer invalidates all the layers that come after, so try
  to place frequently changed layers near the bottom of a Dockerfile.
- Each docker instructions creates a new layer, so minimize the amount
  of docker instructions by maximizing what each docker instruction
  does.
- Always specify a version when installing either software or pulling
  from a base image.  This will make things predictable and help proof
  against missing versions, backwards compatibility issues, etc...
- Never include sensitive data in a Docker image.  If a container
  needs sensitive information, pass it in using environment variables
  or by mounting a volume with the sensitive data in it.
- Don't use *CMD* or *ENTRYPOINT* as the root user.  Preface it with a
  *USER* directive to run it as a non-privileged user, if possible.
